# TechAcademyC-SharpProjects
This is a collection of projects completed during the C#/.NET course at the Tech Academy. These projects were a fun and challenging introduction into the world of C#. Many of these are short exercises, but some of the smaller projects include:

## Projects
* Car Insurance
* Daily Report
* Input Assignment


### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC application that mimics an actual car insurance website. It calculates quotes based on user inputs, and has a created admin page to display all issued quotes along with the user information.

### Daily Report
This is a console application created using C# that mimics the actual form that we submit to the school. It asks the student a series of questions and takes in the appropriate responses.

### Input Assignment
This is a simple program that allows the user to enter a number, takes that number and writes it to a log file, and then returns all the values in the log to the console.
